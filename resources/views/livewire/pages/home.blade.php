    Who the hell am I?
    ==================

    I'm [@adamwathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan), a full-stack developer, entrepreneur, and [Justin's worst nightmare](https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1065299912013709312).

    I share everything I know about making awesome software through my [articles](/articles), [talks](/talks), [screencasts](/screencasts), [podcast](/podcast), and [courses](/courses).

    In 2016, I released my first book and left my job to [make things](/projects) full-time that help other developers build better software.

    Right now I'm working on [Tailwind CSS](/going-full-time-on-tailwind-css), and I share updates about my progress in my [work journal](/journal).

    Curious about how I work? Check out my [uses](/uses) page for a full list of all the software, gadgets, and services I use.
